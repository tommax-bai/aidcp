## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Joined-group coverage selector is the normal Facebook comment container source

The Facebook comment pipeline SHALL use the joined-group coverage selector as the normal source of comment containers for unpinned Facebook comment attempts. The selector MUST only return groups the account itself has joined (`status='joined'`) and MUST return one concrete group URL for edge to use as `facebook.search.execute.container`. It MUST NOT return operator-configured container rows, random imported targets, or any whole-site search sentinel.

#### Scenario: Normal comment uses an account joined group
- **WHEN** an unpinned Facebook comment attempt starts for account A
- **THEN** the selected search container is one of account A's own joined membership rows and edge receives that group URL as the scoped search container

#### Scenario: No joined group does not fall back to legacy containers
- **WHEN** account A has no joined membership rows
- **THEN** the attempt ends with an honest no-targets result and MUST NOT fall back to legacy account-configured containers or whole-site search
