## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Electron and controlled browser prompt when an account lacks persona
The Electron companion SHALL actively surface persona setup when an environment is logged in, connected to cloud, and the bound account has no persona. It MUST open the account persona dialog and emit a desktop notification once per unresolved environment/account condition. It SHALL also show an AIDCP-owned reminder inside that environment's controlled browser page, including when the environment is not selected in Electron. It MUST remove the controlled-page reminder once the account is persona-bound or no longer ready, MUST NOT repeatedly reopen the Electron dialog on every status tick, and MUST keep browser-page reminder state isolated by environment.

The companion MUST NOT treat a just-connected environment as unbound during a bounded grace window after it first becomes logged-in + cloud-connected. Because the authoritative persona-bound signal is sent sticky-true (only when bound) on a cloud tick after the initial connect, a transient "not yet bound" reading is not authoritative. Within the grace window the companion MUST NOT auto-open the persona dialog, emit a notification, or push the controlled-page reminder. It MUST prompt only after the grace elapses with the account still unbound, and MUST guarantee (via a re-evaluation) that a still-unbound account is eventually prompted even without further status pushes. An account whose persona-bound signal (or successful local persona persistence) arrives within the grace MUST never be prompted. The grace applies to both the Electron dialog/notification and the controlled-page reminder.

#### Scenario: Unbound logged-in account opens persona prompts after the grace
- **WHEN** an environment reports `auth='logged in'`, `cloud='connected'`, and no `personaBound`, and the grace window has elapsed with the account still unbound
- **THEN** Electron opens the account persona dialog for that environment and sends one desktop notification
- **AND** the same environment's controlled browser page shows a reminder to complete persona setup in AIDCP Edge

#### Scenario: Already-bound account is not prompted during the pre-personaBound window
- **WHEN** an environment becomes logged-in + cloud-connected and its authoritative `personaBound=true` signal arrives within the grace window
- **THEN** Electron never auto-opens the persona dialog, never emits a notification, and never pushes the controlled-page reminder for that environment
- **AND** the environment is shown as persona-set

#### Scenario: No prompt within the grace window
- **WHEN** an environment has just become logged-in + cloud-connected and its persona-bound state is not yet known, still within the grace window
- **THEN** Electron does not auto-open the persona dialog, does not emit a notification, and does not push the controlled-page reminder

#### Scenario: Background environment receives its own browser reminder
- **WHEN** an unresolved environment reports missing persona (past its grace) while another environment is selected in Electron
- **THEN** the unresolved environment's own browser page shows the reminder
- **AND** the selected environment's browser page does not receive that reminder

#### Scenario: Status ticks do not spam Electron prompts
- **WHEN** the same unresolved environment/account continues to report unbound persona across repeated status updates
- **THEN** Electron keeps at most one active dialog prompt and desktop notification for that unresolved condition

#### Scenario: Bound account removes all unresolved reminders
- **WHEN** the environment reports `personaBound=true` or persona persistence succeeds locally
- **THEN** Electron clears the unresolved prompt state
- **AND** the edge child removes the AIDCP reminder from the controlled browser page

#### Scenario: Browser navigation preserves unresolved reminder
- **WHEN** the controlled page navigates or its CDP connection recovers while the account remains unresolved
- **THEN** the edge child reapplies the reminder to the current top-level document without requiring another cloud state transition

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Driven browser windows default to primary-screen parking with reliable placement
The Electron companion SHALL offer a `primary-screen` parking mode and SHALL make it the default. In this mode the driven browser window MUST be placed fully within the primary display's work area (a right-aligned background slot at full render size), a position the operating system honors, so the window neither tucks off-screen unexpectedly nor is clamped back into an unintended position. Parking MUST keep the browser rendering (no minimize/headless) and MUST NOT steal focus. The prior `edge-strip`, `offscreen`, and `parking-display` modes SHALL remain selectable. When a mode's requested bounds fail the post-placement visibility check, the fallback MUST target a reliably-visible on-primary position rather than an off-screen strip. A failure to apply parking at startup MUST NOT disable the per-environment show / re-park control channel.

#### Scenario: Primary-screen is the default and stays on the primary display
- **WHEN** settings do not specify a parking mode, or specify `primary-screen`
- **THEN** the driven window is placed fully within the primary display's work area at full render size
- **AND** the window keeps rendering and does not take focus

#### Scenario: Parking-display without a secondary display falls back to the default
- **WHEN** `parking-display` is selected but no secondary display is available
- **THEN** the window is parked using the default (`primary-screen`) placement
- **AND** the effective mode and the applied bounds are consistent with each other

#### Scenario: Parking-apply failure does not disable control
- **WHEN** applying parking at startup throws (e.g. the visibility check fails for both the primary and fallback bounds)
- **THEN** the environment still installs its stdin control listener
- **AND** the show / re-park commands remain available for that environment

### Requirement: Environment rail avatar cycles select, show-on-primary, and re-park
Clicking an environment's rail entry SHALL act as a three-state control for that environment. The first click (on a not-yet-selected environment) selects it and highlights it with a distinct color. On the already-selected environment, the next click raises that environment's driven browser to the primary screen and focuses it; the following click sends the browser back to its parked slot; further clicks continue to toggle between raised and parked. The selected-environment highlight MUST be visually distinct, and the raised state MUST be visually distinguishable from the merely-selected state. The show and re-park actions MUST reuse the existing per-environment control channel and MUST honestly surface failure; a failed action (for example, the browser is not yet ready) MUST NOT advance the toggle phase. Switching to a different environment MUST reset the toggle phase. The persona icon on a rail entry MUST NOT trigger this toggle.

#### Scenario: First click selects with a distinct highlight
- **WHEN** the operator clicks a rail entry that is not currently selected
- **THEN** that environment becomes selected and is highlighted with the distinct selected color
- **AND** no browser show / re-park command is sent

#### Scenario: Second click raises the browser to the primary screen
- **WHEN** the operator clicks the already-selected environment's rail entry and its browser is parked
- **THEN** the companion requests that environment's browser be moved to the primary screen and focused
- **AND** the rail entry reflects the raised state

#### Scenario: Third click re-parks the browser
- **WHEN** the operator clicks the already-selected environment's rail entry while its browser is raised
- **THEN** the companion requests that environment's browser return to its parked slot
- **AND** the raised state is cleared

#### Scenario: Honest failure does not advance the toggle
- **WHEN** a show or re-park request fails because the environment's browser is not running/ready
- **THEN** the companion surfaces the failure
- **AND** the toggle phase does not advance
