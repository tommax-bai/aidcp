## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Electron and controlled browser prompt when an account lacks persona
The Electron companion SHALL actively surface persona setup when an environment is logged in, connected to cloud, and the bound account has no persona. It MUST open the account persona dialog and emit a desktop notification once per unresolved environment/account condition. It SHALL also show an AIDCP-owned reminder inside that environment's controlled browser page, including when the environment is not selected in Electron. It MUST remove the controlled-page reminder once the account is persona-bound or no longer ready, MUST NOT repeatedly reopen the Electron dialog on every status tick, and MUST keep browser-page reminder state isolated by environment.

#### Scenario: Unbound logged-in account opens persona prompts
- **WHEN** an environment reports `auth='logged in'`, `cloud='connected'`, and no `personaBound`
- **THEN** Electron opens the account persona dialog for that environment and sends one desktop notification
- **AND** the same environment's controlled browser page shows a reminder to complete persona setup in AIDCP Edge

#### Scenario: Background environment receives its own browser reminder
- **WHEN** an unresolved environment reports missing persona while another environment is selected in Electron
- **THEN** the unresolved environment's own browser page shows the reminder
- **AND** the selected environment's browser page does not receive that reminder

#### Scenario: Status ticks do not spam Electron prompts
- **WHEN** the same unresolved environment/account continues to report unbound persona across repeated status updates
- **THEN** Electron keeps at most one active dialog prompt and desktop notification for that unresolved condition

#### Scenario: Bound account removes all unresolved reminders
- **WHEN** the environment reports `personaBound=true` or persona persistence succeeds locally
- **THEN** Electron clears the unresolved prompt state
- **AND** the edge child removes the AIDCP reminder from the controlled browser page

#### Scenario: Browser navigation preserves unresolved reminder
- **WHEN** the controlled page navigates or its CDP connection recovers while the account remains unresolved
- **THEN** the edge child reapplies the reminder to the current top-level document without requiring another cloud state transition

### Requirement: Controlled-page persona reminder is isolated and non-authoritative
The controlled-page persona reminder SHALL be rendered in a namespaced Shadow DOM host owned by AIDCP. It SHALL contain only reminder copy and a dismiss control, MUST NOT expose the full persona form, MUST NOT mutate site-owned nodes, and MUST NOT claim that dismissing the reminder binds or authorizes a persona.

#### Scenario: Site DOM remains untouched
- **WHEN** the edge child shows the controlled-page reminder
- **THEN** it appends or updates only the AIDCP namespaced host and its shadow tree
- **AND** site-owned DOM nodes and classes remain unchanged

#### Scenario: Operator dismisses browser reminder
- **WHEN** the operator dismisses the controlled-page reminder
- **THEN** the current reminder host is removed from the page
- **AND** the account remains unresolved until persona persistence succeeds in Electron

### Requirement: Persona wizard uses tone and content-preference panels
The Electron persona wizard SHALL present exactly two operator-facing selection panels before generation: `语气调性` first, followed by `内容偏好`. `内容偏好` SHALL group second-level interests under category titles, using the category title as the section title and interest buttons as selectable options.

#### Scenario: Tone panel appears first
- **WHEN** the persona wizard is visible for an unbound ready account
- **THEN** the first selection panel is titled `语气调性`
- **AND** the content-preference panel appears below it

#### Scenario: Recruitment category is first
- **WHEN** the content-preference panel renders
- **THEN** the first category is `招聘求职`
- **AND** it includes `骑手外卖`, `蓝领零工`, `数据标注`, `自有兼职`, and `在校实习`

### Requirement: Content-preference groups allow custom interests
Each content-preference group SHALL expose a `+` custom action. A valid custom interest MUST appear as a selected option in that group, MUST participate in `persona.generate`, and MUST remain bounded by client and cloud persona keyword limits.

#### Scenario: Add custom interest to a category
- **WHEN** the operator clicks `+` beside a content-preference group and enters a valid custom interest
- **THEN** the custom interest appears selected in that group
- **AND** persona generation includes the category title and custom interest in `keywordSelections`

#### Scenario: Empty custom interest is ignored
- **WHEN** the operator submits an empty or whitespace-only custom interest
- **THEN** no custom option is added and existing selections remain unchanged

### Requirement: Browser permission prompts are handled honestly
The Electron shell SHALL deny browser permission requests in the app window unless explicitly allowed by a narrow allowlist. Sensitive or unknown permissions SHALL fail closed and the client SHALL surface a throttled desktop notification explaining the denial. It MUST NOT report the page as successfully authorized.

#### Scenario: Geolocation request is denied and surfaced
- **WHEN** an Electron-loaded page requests geolocation permission
- **THEN** the app denies the request
- **AND** the operator receives a notification explaining that the permission was blocked

#### Scenario: Unknown permission fails closed
- **WHEN** an Electron-loaded page requests an unrecognized permission that is not explicitly allowed
- **THEN** the app denies the request rather than granting it silently
